This endpoint is the Well-Known URI(see [RFC 5785](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5785.html)) for openEO.This allows a client to easily identify the most recent openEOimplementation it supports. By default, a client SHOULD connect to themost recent production-ready version it supports. If not available, themost recent supported version of *all* versions SHOULD be connected to.Clients MAY let users choose to connect to versions that are notproduction-ready or outdated.The most recent version is determined by comparing the version numbersaccording to rules from [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/),especially [§11](https://semver.org/#spec-item-11). Any pair of APIversions in this list MUST NOT be equal according to Semantic Versioning.The Well-Known URI is the entry point for clients and users, so makesure it is permanent and easy to use and remember. Clients MUST NOTrequire the well-known path (`/.well-known/openeo`) in the URL that isspecified by a user to connect to the back-end.For clients, the usual behavior SHOULD follow these steps:1. The user provides a URI, which may consist of a scheme (protocol),    an authority (host, port) and a path.2. The client parses the URI and appends `/.well-knwon/openeo` to the   path. Make sure to correctly handle leading/trailing slashes.3. Send a request to the new URI.   A. On success: Detect the most suitable API instance/version (see above)      and read the [capabilites](#tag/Capabilities/operation/capabilities)      from there.   B. On failure: Directly try to read the capabilities from the original URI      given by the user.**This URI MUST NOT be versioned as the other endpoints.**If your API is available at `https://openeo.example/api/v1`, andyou instruct your API users to use `https://openeo.example` as connection URI, the Well-Known URI SHOULD be located at `https://openeo.example/.well-known/openeo`.The Well-Known URI is usually directly located at the top-level, but it is not arequirement. For example, `https://openeo.example/eo/.well-known/openeo` is also allowed.Clients MAY get additional information (e.g. title or description) abouta back-end from the most recent version that has the `production` flagset to `true`.
